I assume that many people do not have the critical thinking skills to question the answers generated by an AI. (Especially with complex data structures from CRM systems.) This could result in a lot of misinformation circulating through companies. Who takes responsibility for these errors? Is it really the human who confirmed the draft? Is he also when he was pressed for time? What happens with entire error chains when data is aggregated upwards to management's?
